Scratch dev notes

future:  attach a `raycaster` to your controllers and look for intersection data that way
	https://aframe.io/docs/0.3.0/components/raycaster.html
	i could just set the “far” to 0 or super small number
	for a proof of concept I can manually create box entities for raycast intersection that represent the grid locations

Q How big are the tiles in a-frame dimensions?
A	> 0.45units

Q how to translate magica voxel dimensions to a-frame
A > 1 voxel = 1 aframe unit (tested with exporting obj)

done
dec3*- moved grid up and adjusted table accordingly, added basic snapping with animation
oct7*- change base plates to 0.5 instead of 0.45, update app with new base plates, try adding multiple grid position cubes
