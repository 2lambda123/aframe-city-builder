Working notes - Oct 7
- triage / fix grid cube hover animation

suggestions:
	donmccurdy - You could also attach a `raycaster` to your controllers and look for intersection data that way
	https://aframe.io/docs/0.3.0/components/raycaster.html
	i could just set the “far” to 0 or super small number
	for a proof of concept I can manually create box entities for raycast intersection that represent the grid locations


*** ANSWERED QUESTIONS / SOLVED:
grid display
- done using https://github.com/dbradleyfl/aframe-gridhelper

Snapping goals:
* NO - snap to nearby objects
* YES - snap a grid

Q How big are the tiles in a-frame dimensions?
A	> 0.45units

Q how to translate magica voxel dimensions to a-frame
A > 1 voxel = 1 aframe unit (tested with exporting obj)

*** MORE THINGS FOR LATER:
** - need to have grid coordinates x y z

done
oct7*- change base plates to 0.5 instead of 0.45
oct7*- update app with new base plates
*- how to indicate which "grid cube" the controller is currently intersecting?
oct7*- add multiple grid position cubes
