Working notes - Sep 18

** - how to display a grid first?
** - need to have grid coordinates x y z

okay now we can see the grid
- increase height of the grid?
- or reduce camera and table accordingly?

Snapping:
* NO - snap to nearby objects
* YES - snap a grid

* on place you shift to a rounded #

tiles
- always same size
- how big are the tiles? in a-frame dimensions?
  - how to translate magica voxel dimensions to a-frame

- base plates are originally 45 x 45 voxels (apparently same as a-frame base units), scaled by 0.01
  > now tile sizes are 0.45

- snap to grid should snap the tile to somewhere within grid
- the user will not know where the grid is
- some sort of mechanism to show the grid
  - and show where the object will land
