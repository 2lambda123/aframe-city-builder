A-Frame project to play with Vive controls required to make drawing and layout type applications. Try out a demo now, Vive required for it to do anything useful:
https://kfarr.github.io/aframe-city-builder

## wishlist
* O - highlight currently overlapping grid location
* O - need to have grid coordinates x y z
* Support more of these objects https://github.com/mikelovesrobots/mmmm
* undo
* clear or delete
* save, load scenes
* X - show a "preview" of the current object - 50% transparency? (Tried this - cannot show object as 50% opacity as it messes up the other aspects of the material. How to fix?)
* physics
* cars to follow prescribed course on roads

## wishlist done
* * - how to snap to grid for bases?
* * - add object
* * - switch current object -> press trackpad button to see the "preview" change
* * - nicer looking table
* * - display a grid
* * - background selection - dark starry skies, what else?
* * - separate right-hand and left-hand object selection: left-hand for "bases", right-hand for "objects"
* * - add support for switching objects in right hand (ie from car to tree, etc.)

## future cool objects to make
* cars, bikes, trucks
* buildings, houses
* parks, trees, light poles, signals, signs
* people
* trains
* bases: intersection, left turn, right turn, green park only, pedestrian and bike path only
* Oh wait they've all been made! Sweet check this out: https://github.com/mikelovesrobots/mmmm
