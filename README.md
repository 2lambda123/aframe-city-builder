* add sunlight day cycle as aframe component http://jeromeetienne.github.io/threex.daynight/examples/basic.html
* firebase or simple db storage for scenes in json or other format
* use a proper build process to combine and minify all the various libraries

* cars to follow prescribed course on roads
* user generated objects / global object store
* add aframe snowplay type support https://github.com/rondagdag/aframe-snow-play
