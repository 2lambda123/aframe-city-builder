### Changed
- Select menu is now separate component apart from city builder logic
  - select menu accepts an array of possible items, images, metadata
  - menu responds to emitted events independent of controllers

- City builder controls logic now loads objects from json files into the dom for the select bar component
- Right controller and object hidden for now, needs add'l work to support two controllers with new menu bar component
